            <h1>Feathered Animals</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Birds are the only living animals known to have feathers. Other animals throughout history have had feathers including avian dinosaurs. Incredibly after being studied, it has been confirmed that the birds of today evolved from non-avian dinosaurs (ones without feathers). This means that the well know statement of the chicken evolving from the T-rex is somewhat true. So if you are wanting a feathered pet, a bird may be your only option.</p>
        <h2>How large is the bird group?</h2>
        <p>There are more then 11,000 known species of birds on earth and they all have there own unique appearances, habits and ways of life.</p>
        <h2>Why do birds migrate?</h2>
        <p>Birds migrate around the world to get away from areas that temperatures are decreasing / to travel to countries that have the species preferred climate and resources. This mostly includes food and nesting options.</p>
        <p>Some birds don't migrate, these are mostly berry / seed eating birds that don't need to fly long distances for food. Another reason may be because the birds can not fly so migrating becomes more difficult and it can be more beneficial for the species to stay put.</p>
